make sure using consistent '' vs ""
follow space between = no space not
use if comprehension and list comprehesions
use the apporiate clean data type
add comments
add python docs
create tests
add type checking :str and -> outputs
add logging
make sure naming is right
consider object classes and where to put functions
organize import statements
python formatting settings for vs code
api request limiting 
api error handling that will throw errors based on response code
